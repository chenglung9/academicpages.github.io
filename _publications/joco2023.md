Abstract: The least cost influence maximization problem aims to determine minimum cost of partial (e.g., monetary) incentives initially given to the influential spreaders on a social network, so that these early adopters exert influence toward their neighbors and prompt influence propagation to reach a desired penetration rate by the end of cascading processes. We first conduct polyhedral analysis on a substructure that describes influence propagation assuming influence weights are unequal, linear and additively separable. Two classes of facet-defining inequalities based on a mixed 0â€“1 knapsack set contained in this substructure are proposed. We characterize another exponential class of valid and facet-defining inequalities utilizing the concept of minimum influencing subset. We show that these inequalities can be separated in polynomial time efficiently. Furthermore, a polynomial-time dynamic programming recursion is presented to solve this problem on a simple cycle graph. For arbitrary graphs, we propose a new exponential class of valid inequalities that dominates the cycle elimination constraints and an efficient separation algorithm for them. A compact convex hull description for a special case is presented. We illustrate the effectiveness of these inequalities via a delayed cut generation algorithm in the computational experiments.

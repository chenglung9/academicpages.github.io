Operations research (OR) is a field that uses analytical methods to help organizations make better decisions by solving complex problems with data-driven approaches. It’s like using advanced math and technology to figure out the best ways to achieve goals, such as scheduling flights, managing supply chains, or allocating resources. One of OR’s unique strengths is its ability to evaluate trade-offs that are too complex for a human to fully assess. By modeling different scenarios and predicting outcomes, OR practioners can help organizations balance competing factors—like cost, time, and risk—in a way that leads to the most efficient, effective solution. This helps businesses and governments make decisions that save time, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.

<span style="color: #FFBF27;">About Me</span>
=======

My name is Leo (Cheng-Lung) Chen. I am a senior operations research developer at Southwest Airlines. Previously I was an operations research consultant at American Airlines. 

My role revolves around a diverse set of responsibilities essential for optimizing airline operations and driving business growth. I work closely with cross-functional teams and analytics professionals to identify valuable business opportunities and conduct comprehensive research on various analytical problems. I also actively engage with engineering, product, operations, and business teams to prioritize and deliver on our technology roadmap. This enables me to provide actionable recommendations to our business partners and influence informed decision-making. Lastly, I continuously stay informed about cutting-edge technical developments in the field of operations research, striking a balance between supporting existing technology and exploring new analytical ideas and solutions to drive continuous improvement.

I receive my Ph.D. in industrial engineering at University of Central Florida advised by [Dr. Vladimir Boginski](https://iems.ucf.edu/faculty/vladimir-boginski/). My research interests include mixed-integer programming, complex networked system modeling and optimization and optimization under uncertainty. Before coming to UCF, I received my MS in operations research from The Ohio State University, MS in industrial engineering from Arizona State University and a Bachelor of Business Administration from Soochow University, Taiwan.
